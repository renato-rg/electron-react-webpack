      If you are trying to build Electron apps using React, or you just
      want to play around with them, feel free to use this
      seed as a starting point.
    </p>

    <p>
      Pay attention to how everything inside src/ folder is bundled
      into build/ folder, how global and scoped CSS work, how to compose
      React components, or simply how Webpack changes relative
      image paths to public paths after bundling the assets.
